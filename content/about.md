I'm passionate about helping others make sense of data. 

Day to day, you can find me building data cleaning pipelines, designing clear visualizations, holding workshops, or working to transform a client's business questions into an insightful application. With a strong background in geospatial technology, I'm happiest any time I get to look at data with lats and longs. 

### Currently

I'm working at the OCHA [Centre for Humanitarian Data](https://centre.humdata.org/) as a Data Scientist. In this role, I'm helping the humanitarian system use data effectively and ethically to predict and respond to humanitarian crises. 

[Plotly](https://plotly.com/) as a Technical Project Lead. In this role, I work with clients to 

### Previously 

Most recently, I worked at [Plotly](https://dash.plotly.com/) to help clients build data-driven web apps. Project highlights included building an [image segmentation interface](https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_highres_segmentation) to help [scientists](https://als.lbl.gov/) understand the molecular structure of matter, and developing new visualization capabilities in Plotly's [JavaScript graphing library](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) to [support the work of electric vehicle engineers](https://twitter.com/plotlygraphs/status/1692239116740534662/photo/1).

My past work experience sits in the humanitarian and non-profit sectors, where I worked to improve how data could be used to anticipate humanitarian emergencies and improve government transparency. I was a Data Scientist at [MapAction](https://mapaction.org/) (and seconded to the UN's [Centre for Humanitarian Data](https://centre.humdata.org/)), and an Open Data Analyst at [OpenNorth](https://www.opennorth.ca/).

I have a MSc in Spatial Data Science and Visualization from UCL's [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/) and a BA in Urban Geography from McGill University. 

If it involves maps or boats, I'm there.
