I am interested in exploring the ways that (geospatial) data can contribute to making cities, towns, and communities more equitable and sustainable. I am particularly fascinated by the applications of non-traditional data sources, such as those from crowdsourcing projects or social media platforms. 

### Currently

I am working as a Humanitarian Data Scientist at [MapAction](https://mapaction.org/). In this role, I am contributing to efforts to improve information management during humanitarian crises. Within the Predictive Analytics Team at the UN OCHA's [Centre for Humanitarian Data](https://centre.humdata.org/), I am also working to create and validate predictive models that can enable early response to crises. 

### Previously 

I have recently completed my MSc in Spatial Data Science and Visualization at UCL's [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/). Through my dissertation, I investigated data maintenance practices in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), following humanitarian mapping campaigns. This work was conducted with support from [Médecins Sans Frontières UK](https://www.msf.org.uk/about-manson-unit) to support the [Missing Maps](https://www.missingmaps.org/) project.

I previously worked in the non-profit sector at [OpenNorth](https://www.opennorth.ca/) as an Open Data Analyst. In this role I worked on various projects to improve data literacy in government, both in Canada and abroad (in Ukraine). Specifically, I worked with stakeholders to improve data management during online and offline [public consultations](https://www.opennorth.ca/2019/06/03/what-we-re-up-to-data-literacy-and-public-consultations), and within [homelessness service providers](https://www.opennorth.ca/2018/12/24/workshop-on-data-management-for-a-homelessness-information-system).

My undergraduate degree is in urban geography, which I studied at McGill University in Montreal. I completed an [Honours Thesis](https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/files/geography/ker_hannah_2018_honoursabstract.pdf) on local perceptions of Montreal's built environment under the supervision of Dr. Renee Sieber and Dr. Raja Sengupta. While at McGill, I was heavily involved with the competitive [sailing team](http://mcgillsailing.org/) and the [Open Mapping Group of McGill](https://www.facebook.com/omgMcGill/). 

If it involves maps or boats, I'm there.
