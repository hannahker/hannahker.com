### Currently

I am pursuing my MSc in Spatial Data Science and Visualization at UCL's [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/). Through my dissertation, I am exploring [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data quality, focusing specifically on issues of data maintenance following humanitarian mapping activities. This work is conducted in collaboration with [Médecins Sans Frontières UK](https://www.msf.org.uk/about-manson-unit) to support the [Missing Maps](https://www.missingmaps.org/) project. 

Broadly, I am interested in exploring the ways that different forms of (geospatial) data can contribute to making cities, towns, and communities more equitable and sustainable. I am particularly fascinated by the applications of non-traditional data sources, such as those from crowdsourcing projects or social media sites. 

Through this master's program, I am expanding my skills in statistical analysis and machine learning, data visualization, and technical communication and collaboration. 

While living in London, I am a resident of [Goodenough College](https://www.goodenough.ac.uk/), thanks in part to generous funding from the [London Goodenough Association of Canada](http://lgac.ca/). 

### Previously 

I most recently worked in the non-profit sector at [OpenNorth](https://www.opennorth.ca/) as an Open Data Analyst. In this role I worked on various projects to improve data literacy in government, both in Canada and abroad (in Ukraine). Specifically, I worked with stakeholders to improve data management during online and offline [public consultations](https://www.opennorth.ca/2019/06/03/what-we-re-up-to-data-literacy-and-public-consultations), and within [homelessness service providers](https://www.opennorth.ca/2018/12/24/workshop-on-data-management-for-a-homelessness-information-system).

My previous education is in urban geography, which I studied at McGill University in Montreal. I completed an [Honours Thesis](https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/files/geography/ker_hannah_2018_honoursabstract.pdf) on local perceptions of Montreal's built environment under the supervision of Dr. Renee Sieber and Dr. Raja Sengupta. While at McGill, I was heavily involved with the competitive [sailing team](http://mcgillsailing.org/) and the [Open Mapping Group of McGill](https://www.facebook.com/omgMcGill/). 

I'm passionate about the humanitarian applications of geospatial data and technologies, and have volunteered with the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) and [Missing Maps](https://www.missingmaps.org/). 

If it involves maps or boats, I'm there.
