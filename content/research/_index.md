These are some more substantial projects that I have completed, during both my postgraduate and undergraduate studies. The majority of my work applies quantitative, data-driven approaches to further our understandings of cities and spatial systems. My work takes advantage of a wide variety of data sources and theoretical frameworks, from measurements of my own heart rate to theories of temporal representation in GIS. To enhance the reproducibility of my work, I have linked to any relevant code or workflows where possible. I aim to conduct all analyses using open-source tools.
