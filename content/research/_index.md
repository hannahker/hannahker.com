These are some more substantial projects that I have completed, during both my postgraduate and undergraduate studies. Broadly, I am interested in understanding cities and spatial systems. The majority of my work is computational, although I aim to apply both quantitative and qualitative methods. My work also takes advantage of a wide variety of data sources and theoretical frameworks, from measurements of my own heart rate to theories of temporal representation in GIS. To enhance the reproducibility of my work, I have linked to any relevant code or workflows where possible. I aim to conduct all analyses using open-source tools.
