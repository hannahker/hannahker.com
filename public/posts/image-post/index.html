I&rsquo;m having a hard time rationalizing these two perspectives. Predictably, my tourist image of the city is dominated by key landmarks, such as the Big Ben, London Eye, and the Thames River. Given that I haven&rsquo;t seen any of these landmarks since arriving to London as a student, I haven&rsquo;t been able to align my memories of London with my more recent experiences.</p></article></div><nav role=navigation class="flex-container bottom-menu"><hr><p><a href=/posts>back</a>
