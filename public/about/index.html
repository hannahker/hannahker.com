<p>I am working as a Humanitarian Data Scientist at <a href="https://mapaction.org/">MapAction</a>. In this role, I am contributing to efforts to improve information management during humanitarian crises. Within the Predictive Analytics Team at the UN OCHA&rsquo;s <a href="https://centre.humdata.org/">Centre for Humanitarian Data</a>, I am also working to create and validate predictive models that can enable early response to crises.</p>

<h3 id="previously" class="anchor-link"><a href="#previously">Previously<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>I have recently completed my MSc in Spatial Data Science and Visualization at UCL&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/">Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis</a>. Through my dissertation, I investigated data maintenance practices in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, following humanitarian mapping campaigns. This work was conducted with support from <a href="https://www.msf.org.uk/about-manson-unit">Médecins Sans Frontières UK</a> to support the <a href="https://www.missingmaps.org/">Missing Maps</a> project.</p>
<p>I previously worked in the non-profit sector at <a href="https://www.opennorth.ca/">OpenNorth</a> as an Open Data Analyst. In this role I worked on various projects to improve data literacy in government, both in Canada and abroad (in Ukraine). Specifically, I worked with stakeholders to improve data management during online and offline <a href="https://www.opennorth.ca/2019/06/03/what-we-re-up-to-data-literacy-and-public-consultations">public consultations</a>, and within <a href="https://www.opennorth.ca/2018/12/24/workshop-on-data-management-for-a-homelessness-information-system">homelessness service providers</a>.</p>
<p>My undergraduate degree is in urban geography, which I studied at McGill University in Montreal. I completed an <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/files/geography/ker_hannah_2018_honoursabstract.pdf">Honours Thesis</a> on local perceptions of Montreal&rsquo;s built environment under the supervision of Dr. Renee Sieber and Dr. Raja Sengupta. While at McGill, I was heavily involved with the competitive <a href="http://mcgillsailing.org/">sailing team</a> and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/omgMcGill/">Open Mapping Group of McGill</a>.</p>
<p>If it involves maps or boats, I&rsquo;m there.</p>
