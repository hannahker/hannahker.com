This is a personal portfolio/blog where I can showcase (mostly for my family&hellip;) things that I&rsquo;m working on and learning.
Currently I&rsquo;m pursuing my MSc in Spatial Data Science and Visualization, at UCL&rsquo;s Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis. I look forward to expanding my skills in GIS, data visualuzation, and quantitative methods, which I hope to apply to make cities more resilient and equitable.
While living in London, I am a resident of Goodenough College, thanks in part to generous funding from the London Goodenough Association of Canada."/>

<p>I&rsquo;m Hannah Ker.</p>

<p>This is a personal portfolio/blog where I can showcase (mostly for my family&hellip;) things that I&rsquo;m working on and learning.</p>

<h3 id="currently">Currently</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m pursuing my MSc in Spatial Data Science and Visualization, at UCL&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/">Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis</a>. I look forward to expanding my skills in GIS, data visualuzation, and quantitative methods, which I hope to apply to make cities more resilient and equitable.</p>

<p>While living in London, I am a resident of <a href="https://www.goodenough.ac.uk/">Goodenough College</a>, thanks in part to generous funding from the <a href="http://lgac.ca/">London Goodenough Association of Canada</a>.</p>

<h3 id="previously">Previously</h3>

<p>I most recently worked in the non-profit sector at <a href="https://www.opennorth.ca/">OpenNorth</a> as an Open Data Analyst. In this role I worked on various projects to improve data literacy in government, both in Canada and abroad.</p>

<p>My previous education is in urban geography, which I studied at McGill University in Montreal. I completed an <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/files/geography/ker_hannah_2018_honoursabstract.pdf">Honours Thesis</a> on local perceptions of Montreal&rsquo;s built environment under the supervision of Dr. Renee Sieber and Dr. Raja Sengupta. While at McGill, I was heavily involved with the competitive <a href="http://mcgillsailing.org/">sailing team</a> and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/omgMcGill/">Open Mapping Group of McGill</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m passionate about the humanitarian applications of geospatial data and technologies, and have volunteered with the <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> and <a href="https://www.missingmaps.org/">Missing Maps</a>.</p>

<p>If it involves maps or boats, I&rsquo;m there.</p>
