      <description>Overview In this project, I was interested in exploring the spatial and temporal characteristics of tweets in London over a week-long time period. I analyzed the clustering patterns of approximately 40,000 tweets in both space and time. I found many clusters that could be linked to specific events taking place in the city. For example, I was able to detect events such as a West Ham vs Watford football game and an Adam Lambert concert.</description>

A city made up of highly legible environments will be clearly imagined in the minds of those that live within it.</description>

      <description>Landscape allows and even encourages us to dream. 1
This quote from the renowned geographer, Yi-Fu Tuan, provides a useful starting point from which to examine the significance of the Orange Julep. While the Orange Julep is a unique building in the midst of a bland urban highway landscape, its existence is so much more than what meets the eye. The fantasy and imagination surrounding the Julep is what gives this Montreal landmark its true significance.</description>
